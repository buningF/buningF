I am a first-year Master of Science student in Statistics at the University of Chicago. I hold a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics (Statistics track) from Boston University, where I graduated magna cum laude. I have worked on data-driven projects in areas such as health research and predictive modeling. I plan to pursue further studies in biostatistics following the completion of my masterâ€™s degree.
