This is a personal website I am making for [STAT 37815: Practical R Programming with Extensions](https://stat.uchicago.edu/academics/course-info/2024-2025-courses/autumn-2024-stat-37815-1/) with [Dr. McShane](https://ryanmcshane.com).

I plan to update this website in the future to reflect my academic and professional journey. Currently, it serves as a platform to showcase my work in statistics, data analysis, and related projects.

Stay tuned for more updates and future additions!
